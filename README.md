I am a student of Seneca College, BSD (Bachelors of software development) program. We have a bunch of BTP (coding related) courses.

Those courses have a website tree. And it is functional, but doesn't look that good. 
Websites mentioned:
https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp100/
https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp200/
https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp305/

This google chrome extension fixes the look of those websites.

It also has a dark theme!
